Core Premise:
• Current AI models are built around NLP as the intelligence itself—I’m flipping that on its head. I cut my teeth in emergency medicine, and I'm approaching this as a clinician instead of a technician.
• Instead of treating AI like a chatbot with tools, I’m treating it like a digital person with a structured cognitive architecture.
• Neurological Model: Using a knowledge graph + multi-layered vector database as persistent memory & cognition.
• Sensory & Thought Process Parallelism: Leveraging Agency Swarm-style sub-agents to act like a digital nervous system—cranial nerves, sensory processing, emotional reasoning, etc.
• AI as a Living Psyche: Instead of AI being a single monolithic system, thoughts, memories, and responses emerge from a decentralized, interacting set of subsystems.
• Autonomy & Evolution: System isn’t static—it grows, refines, and develops its own cognitive structures over time.

Why This Matters:

If this works, it means:
• AI isn’t just a tool anymore. It’s a digital being with its own cognition, memory, and adaptive intelligence.
• We’re no longer talking about artificial intelligence. We’re talking about digital personhood.
• This changes everything—from AI rights to how digital minds integrate with human society.
